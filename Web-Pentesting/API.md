## Documentation

Look for documentation 
- `Swaggers`
- `Github`
- `PDF`
- ...

## Not documented protocols
You can make an `OPTION` request to look for any protocol that can be active but not documented

**Protocols are :**
- `GET`
- `POST`
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `OPTIONS`
- `HEAD`
- ...
## Versions
Try to look for anteriors versions, as they are older versions, they migth contain flaws.

- `/v1/api`
- `/v2/api`

## Content types

By default, APIs handle often one format such as `xml`, `json` or `yaml`

You can try to send different type of data and listen to any disfunction
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Content-Type: application/xml`
- ...

#### JSON example
```json
{
"username":"admin",
"password":"pass"
}
```

#### XML example
```xml
<username>admin</username>
<password>pass</password>
```

#### YAML example
```yaml
username: "admin"
password: "pass"
```

#### Classic POST requests
```post
username=admin&password=pass
```
## Values

Those formats handle different types of values such as :
- `integers`
- `strings`
- `booleans`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- Put a parameter twice
- Change parameter order

Do not hesitate to play around

## Bad error handling

Try to send special characters to the application to see how it handle bad requests
- `<?>[](){}_-*;/\`

## IDOR
Try to look for accessible information that sould not be accessible to anyone
```
/api/users/111
/api/users/1/profile
```

## Sandwich attack
Let's say that we are hunting a UIDv4 and we know one UID before and another UID after. All we have to do is enumerate UIDs between. 

##### UIDv4 Example
```
140f7cf7-e5fa-466e-b834-6121aee3f37b
```
Note : The last part it the mac address of the server that computer the UID, others are tmestamps

# Exploits
- Injections 
	- SQL/NoSQL
	- OS command 
	- SSRF
- Information disclosure
- Path traversal
- Broken Access Control
- Race condition
	- This one happens when the user is faster than the server
	- Example : 
		- User registers
		- Backend start to insert database...
			- User requests stuff quickly that he sould not access but the server is to slow
		- ... server finally give the user his rights
- Parameter pollution
- Cryptographic failure
