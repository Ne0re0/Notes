# Cybersecurity Learning Notes

This repository contains a collection of notes from my cybersecurity learning routine, and I don't want to lose them.

**Note:** Don't take this repository too seriously ðŸ˜„

You'll encounter a peculiar mix of French and English, and sometimes there might be content that's not easy to understand. These notes are primarily intended for my own comprehension.

I hope you find them useful too!
