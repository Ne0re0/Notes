# Forks

*if a guy forks a repository, he can start working on it. He doesn't have to wait to talk to the owner and get the owner to add him as a contributor specifically.*

1. The guy forks the repository `/tom/repo`. We call the `/tom/repo` repository the `Upstream Repository`. 
2. The repository is now available in Hari's (the guy) GitHub account as `/hari/repo`. We call the `hari/repo` the `Forked Repository`.
3. Hari makes the required changes and pushes the changes to the forked repository.
4. Finally, Hari creates a `Pull Request` from the `forked repository` to the `upstream repository`. Tom reviews the pull request at his convenience to approve and merge it if all goes well.
